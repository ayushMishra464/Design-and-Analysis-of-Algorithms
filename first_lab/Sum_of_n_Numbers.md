Sum of N Numbers
This C++ program calculates the sum of N numbers and measures the average time taken for different values of N. It also generates a plot using Gnuplot to visualize the average time taken.

Requirements
C++ compiler
Gnuplot (for visualization)
How to Use
Compile the program using any C++ compiler.


g++ sum_of_n.cpp -o sum_of_n
Run the executable.


./sum_of_n
The program will generate data in a file named data1.txt.

Gnuplot is used to plot the data. Ensure Gnuplot is installed on your system. If not, install it using appropriate package manager for your operating system.

After running the program, a chart will be displayed showing the average time taken for different values of N.

Sum of N Numbers
This C++ program calculates the sum of N numbers and measures the average time taken for different values of N. It also generates a plot using Gnuplot to visualize the average time taken.

Use of This Algorithm
The algorithm implemented in this program computes the sum of N numbers using a simple loop. It iterates through the array of numbers and accumulates their values to compute the sum. This algorithm can be used in various applications where the sum of a sequence of numbers needs to be calculated, such as statistical analysis, mathematical computations, and data processing.

Complexity of This Algorithm
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm iterates through the array once to compute the sum. As the size of the input (N) increases, the time taken by the algorithm also increases linearly.

Analysis of Time Graph
The program generates a graph showing the average time taken for different values of N. As N increases, the time taken to compute the sum also increases. However, since the algorithm has linear time complexity, the graph should exhibit a linear relationship between N and the average time. This means that the slope of the graph should remain relatively constant, indicating that the algorithm's performance scales linearly with the input size.

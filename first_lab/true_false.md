# True-False Random Generator

## Introduction
This C++ program generates all possible combinations of true and false values for a given number of iterations. It measures the average time taken to generate these combinations for different numbers of iterations and visualizes the data using Gnuplot.

## Code Explanation
- The program defines a recursive function `True_False_fun` to generate all possible combinations of true and false values.
- The `generat_e` function generates random numbers to simulate iterations in the true-false combinations.
- The `avg_time` function measures the average time taken to generate the combinations for different numbers of iterations and writes the data to a file.
- The `PlotChart` function uses Gnuplot to plot the data generated by `avg_time`.
- The main function `main` calls `avg_time` to measure the average time and plot the data.

## Algorithm
The algorithm generates all possible combinations of true and false values for a given number of iterations using a recursive approach. It starts with an empty string and recursively appends 'T' or 'F' for each iteration, resulting in all possible combinations.

## Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(2^N), where N is the number of iterations. This is because the number of combinations doubles with each additional iteration.

## Graph Analysis
The program generates a graph showing the average time taken to generate true-false combinations for different numbers of iterations. As the number of iterations increases, the time taken also increases exponentially. This is reflected in the plotted graph.

## Usage
1. **Compile the program**: Use any C++ compiler to compile the program.
    ```
    g++ true_false_generator.cpp -o true_false_generator
    ```

2. **Run the executable**: Execute the compiled program.
    ```
    ./true_false_generator
    ```

3. **View the results**: After execution, a chart will be displayed showing the average time taken for different numbers of iterations.

## Files
- `true_false_generator.cpp`: Contains the C++ source code.
- `data1.txt`: Generated data file containing the number of iterations and their corresponding average times.
- `README.md`: This file, providing instructions and information about the program.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler
- Gnuplot (for visualization)

## Notes
- Modify the loop parameters in `avg_time` function for different ranges of iterations.
- Ensure Gnuplot is installed on your system to visualize the generated data.

# Towers of Hanoi

## Introduction
This C++ program solves the Towers of Hanoi problem recursively and measures the average time taken for different numbers of disks. It also generates a plot using Gnuplot to visualize the average time taken.

## Code Explanation
- The program defines a recursive function `Towers_of_hanoi` to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem.
- The `generat_e` function generates random numbers to simulate disks in the Towers of Hanoi problem.
- The `avg_time` function measures the average time taken to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem for different numbers of disks and writes the data to a file.
- The `PlotChart` function uses Gnuplot to plot the data generated by `avg_time`.
- The main function `main` calls `avg_time` to measure the average time and plot the data.

## Towers of Hanoi Algorithm
The Towers of Hanoi problem is a classic recursive problem. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The objective is to move the entire stack of disks from the first rod to the last rod, obeying the following rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## Complexity
The time complexity of the Towers of Hanoi problem is O(2^N), where N is the number of disks. This is because the number of moves required to solve the problem doubles with each additional disk.

## Graph Analysis
The program generates a graph showing the average time taken to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem for different numbers of disks. As the number of disks increases, the time taken to solve the problem also increases exponentially. This is reflected in the plotted graph.

## Usage
1. **Compile the program**: Use any C++ compiler to compile the program.
    ```
    g++ towers_of_hanoi.cpp -o towers_of_hanoi
    ```

2. **Run the executable**: Execute the compiled program.
    ```
    ./towers_of_hanoi
    ```

3. **View the results**: After execution, a chart will be displayed showing the average time taken for different numbers of disks.

## Files
- `towers_of_hanoi.cpp`: Contains the C++ source code.
- `data1.txt`: Generated data file containing the number of disks and their corresponding average times.
- `README.md`: This file, providing instructions and information about the program.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler
- Gnuplot (for visualization)

## Notes
- Modify the loop parameters in `avg_time` function for different ranges of numbers of disks.
- Ensure Gnuplot is installed on your system to visualize the generated data.

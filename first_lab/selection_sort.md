### Selection Sort Implementation

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm along with a simple script to plot a graph demonstrating its time complexity.

### Time Complexity

Selection Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because it involves two nested loops. However, it performs better than other quadratic-time sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort because of its reduced number of swaps.

### Code Breakdown

- **Generate**: Function to populate an array with random integers.
- **selection_sort**: Function implementing the Selection Sort algorithm.
- **Algorithm**: Function to test the sorting algorithm's performance by sorting arrays of increasing sizes and calculating the average time taken for sorting.
- **WriteDataToFile**: Function to write data (array size and average sorting time) to a file named "data.txt".
- **PlotChart**: Function to plot a graph using Gnuplot based on the data in "data.txt".
- **main**: The entry point of the program, calling the Algorithm function to execute the sorting algorithm and generate data for plotting.

### Application

Selection Sort, although inefficient for large datasets, can be useful for small arrays or as a building block in more complex algorithms. Its simplicity makes it easy to implement and understand, and it can be useful in educational contexts for teaching sorting algorithms.

### Graph Analysis

The graph generated by the provided script demonstrates the relationship between the size of the input array and the average time taken for sorting. As expected, the graph exhibits a quadratic growth pattern, consistent with the O(n^2) time complexity of Selection Sort. It highlights the inefficiency of Selection Sort for larger datasets compared to more efficient sorting algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort.

### Usage

To compile and run the program:
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o selection_sort
./selection_sort
```
Ensure that Gnuplot is installed on your system to visualize the graph.

### Magic Square Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Magic Square algorithm along with a script to generate data for plotting.

### Description

The Magic Square algorithm generates a square matrix of odd order (n x n) where the sum of numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same. This implementation dynamically allocates a 2D array to generate the magic square and measures the average time taken to generate the square.

### Code Breakdown

- **WriteDataToFile**: Function to write data (order of the square and average time taken) to a file named "Magic_square_data.txt".
- **PlotChart**: Function to plot a graph using Gnuplot based on the data in "Magic_square_data.txt".
- **generator**: Function to initialize a 2D array with zeros.
- **magic_sq**: Function to generate a magic square using the given algorithm.
- **Algorithm**: Function to test the performance of the Magic Square algorithm by generating magic squares of increasing order and calculating the average time taken for generation.
- **main**: The entry point of the program, calling the Algorithm function to execute the Magic Square algorithm and generate data for plotting.

### Application

Magic squares have been of interest in recreational mathematics and various fields like cryptography, computer science, and even art due to their historical significance and mathematical properties. They are used as puzzles, in games, and have cultural significance in some societies.

### Graph Analysis

The graph generated by the provided script demonstrates the relationship between the order of the magic square and the average time taken for its generation. As the order of the square increases, the time taken for generation also increases. However, the growth may not be linear due to various factors such as the algorithm's efficiency and the computational resources available. Analyzing the graph can provide insights into the algorithm's performance and scalability.

### Usage

To compile and run the program:
```bash
g++ magic_square.cpp -o magic_square
./magic_square
```
Ensure that Gnuplot is installed on your system to visualize the graph.

### Data Generation

The program measures the average time taken by the Magic Square algorithm for generating magic squares of odd order ranging from 9 to 50. It performs 10 iterations for each order to calculate the average time accurately. The results are stored in the "Magic_square_data.txt" file, with each line containing the order of the square and the corresponding average time taken in milliseconds.

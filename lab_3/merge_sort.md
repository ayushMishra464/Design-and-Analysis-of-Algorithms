### Merge Sort Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm along with a script to generate data for plotting.

### Description

The Merge Sort algorithm is implemented to sort an array of integers in ascending order. It divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges them back together in sorted order. The implementation measures the average time taken by the Merge Sort algorithm for sorting arrays of increasing sizes.

### Code Breakdown

- **WriteDataToFile**: Function to write data (array size and average time taken) to a file named "data.txt".
- **PlotChart**: Function to plot a graph using Gnuplot based on the data in "data.txt".
- **Generate**: Function to generate random numbers and populate an array with them.
- **merge**: Function to merge two sorted halves of an array into a single sorted array.
- **mergeSort**: Recursive function to perform Merge Sort on an array.
- **Algorithm**: Function to test the performance of the Merge Sort algorithm by sorting arrays of increasing sizes and calculating the average time taken for sorting.
- **main**: The entry point of the program, calling the Algorithm function to execute the Merge Sort algorithm and generate data for plotting.

### Application

Merge Sort is a popular sorting algorithm known for its stability and efficiency. It is widely used in various applications where sorting large datasets efficiently is required. Merge Sort's time complexity of O(n log n) makes it suitable for sorting large datasets in scenarios like external sorting, where data cannot entirely fit into memory.

### Graph Analysis

The graph generated by the provided script illustrates the relationship between the size of the input array and the average time taken to sort the array using Merge Sort. As the size of the array increases, the time taken also increases, demonstrating the algorithm's scalability. The graph's pattern provides insights into the algorithm's performance, showing its efficiency for larger datasets compared to algorithms with higher time complexities.

### Usage

To compile and run the program:
```bash
g++ merge_sort.cpp -o merge_sort
./merge_sort
```
Ensure that Gnuplot is installed on your system to visualize the graph.

### Data Generation

The program measures the average time taken by the Merge Sort algorithm for sorting arrays of sizes ranging from 1000 to 50000. It performs 10 iterations for each array size to calculate the average time accurately. The results are stored in the "data.txt" file, with each line containing the array size and the corresponding average time taken in milliseconds.

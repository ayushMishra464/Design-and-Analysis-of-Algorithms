### Quick Sort Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm along with a script to generate data for plotting.

### Description

The Quick Sort algorithm is implemented to sort an array of integers in ascending order. It selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two subarrays such that elements less than the pivot are on its left, and elements greater than the pivot are on its right. It then recursively applies the same process to the subarrays until the entire array is sorted. The implementation measures the average time taken by the Quick Sort algorithm for sorting arrays of increasing sizes.

### Code Breakdown

- **WriteDataToFile**: Function to write data (array size and average time taken) to a file named "data.txt".
- **PlotChart**: Function to plot a graph using Gnuplot based on the data in "data.txt".
- **Generate**: Function to generate random numbers and populate an array with them.
- **partition**: Function to partition the array and return the index of the pivot element.
- **quick_sort**: Recursive function to perform Quick Sort on an array.
- **Algorithm**: Function to test the performance of the Quick Sort algorithm by sorting arrays of increasing sizes and calculating the average time taken for sorting.
- **main**: The entry point of the program, calling the Algorithm function to execute the Quick Sort algorithm and generate data for plotting.

### Algorithm

1. Choose a pivot element from the array.
2. Partition the array into two subarrays: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot.
3. Recursively apply Quick Sort to the subarrays.
4. Combine the sorted subarrays to get the final sorted array.

### Application

Quick Sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms and is widely used in practice due to its average-case time complexity of O(n log n). It is used in various applications where sorting large datasets efficiently is required, such as sorting algorithms libraries, database management systems, and programming languages implementations.

### Graph Analysis

The graph generated by the provided script illustrates the relationship between the size of the input array and the average time taken to sort the array using Quick Sort. As the size of the array increases, the time taken also increases, demonstrating the algorithm's scalability.

Quick Sort's time complexity of O(n log n) on average makes it efficient for sorting large datasets. The graph's pattern reflects this efficiency, showing a relatively smooth curve with increasing array sizes. However, there might be some fluctuations due to variations in input data and system conditions.

The graph analysis provides insights into the performance characteristics of the Quick Sort algorithm. It helps understand how the algorithm behaves under different input sizes and aids in evaluating its suitability for sorting tasks in real-world applications. Additionally, it allows for comparisons with other sorting algorithms to make informed decisions based on performance requirements.

By analyzing the graph, one can determine the algorithm's efficiency and scalability, enabling better optimization and resource allocation for sorting tasks. It also highlights potential areas for further optimization or algorithmic improvements to enhance performance in specific use cases.

### Usage

To compile and run the program:
```bash
g++ quick_sort.cpp -o quick_sort
./quick_sort
```
Ensure that Gnuplot is installed on your system to visualize the graph.

### Data Generation

The program measures the average time taken by the Quick Sort algorithm for sorting arrays of sizes ranging from 500 to 4500. It performs 10 iterations for each array size to calculate the average time accurately. The results are stored in the "data.txt" file, with each line containing the array size and the corresponding average time taken in milliseconds.

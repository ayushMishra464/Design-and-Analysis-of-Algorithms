### Custom Merge Sort Implementation

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm along with a script to generate data for plotting.

### Description

The Merge Sort algorithm is implemented with a custom approach in this code. Instead of using the standard `std::merge` function, a custom `sort_array` function is used to merge two sorted halves of the array. The algorithm first sorts the first half and the second half separately using `std::sort`, and then merges these two sorted halves using the custom merge function.

### Code Breakdown

- **WriteDataToFile**: Function to write data (array size and average sorting time) to a file named "data.txt".
- **PlotChart**: Function to plot a graph using Gnuplot based on the data in "data.txt".
- **sort_array**: Custom function to merge two sorted halves of an array.
- **Algorithm**: Function to test the sorting algorithm's performance by sorting arrays of increasing sizes and calculating the average time taken for sorting.
- **main**: The entry point of the program, calling the Algorithm function to execute the sorting algorithm and generate data for plotting.

### Application

Merge Sort is a widely used sorting algorithm known for its stability and efficiency. It is often used in scenarios where stability is important, such as in external sorting algorithms, where data is stored on disk and not entirely in memory. Additionally, Merge Sort's time complexity of O(n log n) makes it suitable for sorting large datasets efficiently.

### Graph Analysis

The data generated by the program can be visualized using plotting tools like Gnuplot or matplotlib. The graph demonstrates the relationship between the size of the input array and the average time taken for sorting. As expected, the graph exhibits a logarithmic growth pattern, consistent with the O(n log n) time complexity of Merge Sort. It highlights the efficiency of Merge Sort for larger datasets compared to quadratic-time sorting algorithms.

### Usage

To compile and run the program:
```bash
g++ custom_merge_sort.cpp -o custom_merge_sort
./custom_merge_sort
```
Ensure that Gnuplot is installed on your system to visualize the graph.

### Data Generation

The program measures the average time taken by the custom Merge Sort algorithm for array sizes ranging from 10,000 to 260,000 with increments of 20,000. It performs 10 iterations for each array size to calculate the average time accurately. The results are stored in the "data.txt" file, with each line containing the array size and the corresponding average time taken in milliseconds.

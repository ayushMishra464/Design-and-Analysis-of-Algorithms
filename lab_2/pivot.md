### Pivot Function Implementation

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Pivot function, which is a crucial step in the Quick Sort algorithm. The Pivot function rearranges the elements of an array such that all elements smaller than a given pivot element are placed before it, and all elements larger than the pivot are placed after it.

### Description

The `pivot` function takes an array `arr`, a pivot element `s`, and the size of the array `size` as input. It rearranges the elements of the array such that the pivot element `s` is placed at its correct position in the sorted array. The function performs this rearrangement by partitioning the array into two halves: one containing elements smaller than the pivot and the other containing elements larger than the pivot. It then swaps the pivot element with the last element of the first half.

### Code Breakdown

- **pivot**: Function to rearrange the elements of an array such that all elements smaller than the pivot are placed before it, and all elements larger than the pivot are placed after it. The function uses a two-pointer approach to partition the array and swaps elements accordingly.
- **main**: The entry point of the program, which demonstrates the usage of the `pivot` function by rearranging elements in an array around a pivot element.

### Application

The Pivot function is a fundamental step in various sorting algorithms, most notably Quick Sort. It efficiently partitions the array into smaller subarrays, making it suitable for sorting large datasets. Additionally, the Pivot function has applications in algorithms that require partitioning data based on a specific criterion.

### Usage

To compile and run the program:
```bash
g++ pivot_function.cpp -o pivot_function
./pivot_function
```
Ensure that the C++ compiler is installed on your system.

### Power Iteration Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Power Iteration algorithm along with a script to generate data for plotting.

### Description

The Power Iteration algorithm calculates the power of a number using an iterative approach. It repeatedly multiplies the base by itself for the specified number of times (exponent).

### Code Breakdown

- **random_generator**: Function to generate random numbers within a specified range and populate an array.
- **power**: Function implementing the Power Iteration algorithm to calculate the power of a given base to a specified exponent.
- **main**: The entry point of the program, which measures the average time taken by the power function for different sizes of exponents and writes the data to a file named "power_ite.txt".

### Application

The Power Iteration algorithm has applications in various fields, including mathematics, physics, and computer science. Some common applications include:

- **Matrix Computation**: Power Iteration is used to find the dominant eigenvalue and eigenvector of a matrix, which has applications in machine learning, quantum mechanics, and network analysis.
- **Iterative Methods**: It is used in numerical analysis for solving systems of linear equations, particularly in the context of iterative methods like the Gauss-Seidel method and Jacobi method.
- **Signal Processing**: Power Iteration is employed in signal processing tasks such as image compression, noise reduction, and audio processing.

### Graph Analysis

The data generated by the program can be visualized using plotting tools like Gnuplot or matplotlib. The graph demonstrates the relationship between the size of the exponent and the average time taken by the Power Iteration algorithm to compute the power. As the exponent size increases, the average time taken also increases, illustrating the algorithm's time complexity.

### Usage

To compile and run the program:
```bash
g++ power_iteration.cpp -o power_iteration
./power_iteration
```
Ensure that the C++ compiler is installed on your system.

### Data Generation

The program measures the average time taken by the power function for exponents ranging from 10 to 100,000. It performs 10 iterations for each exponent size to calculate the average time accurately. The results are stored in the "power_ite.txt" file, with each line containing the exponent size and the corresponding average time taken in microseconds.

### Repository Structure

- **power_iteration.cpp**: Contains the C++ implementation of the Power Iteration algorithm and the script to generate data for plotting.
- **power_ite.txt**: File where data (exponent size and average time taken) is stored.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the repository and its contents.

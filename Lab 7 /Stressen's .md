# Strassen's Matrix Multiplication

## Algorithm
Strassen's algorithm is a divide-and-conquer method for matrix multiplication. It works by recursively dividing the input matrices into smaller submatrices, performing a series of mathematical operations, and then combining the results to compute the final matrix product.

The steps of Strassen's algorithm are as follows:

1. **Divide:** Take the two input matrices A and B, and split them into four smaller matrices each, roughly half the size of the original matrices.
2. **Calculate:** Use these smaller matrices to compute seven intermediate matrices, denoted as P1 to P7, by performing specific arithmetic operations involving additions and subtractions.
3. **Combine:** Use the values of the intermediate matrices P1 to P7 to compute the final result matrix C by combining them using addition and subtraction operations.

The algorithm achieves a reduction in the number of scalar multiplications compared to traditional matrix multiplication algorithms, leading to improved efficiency, particularly for large matrices.

## Usage
This program performs matrix multiplication using Strassen's algorithm. You can input two matrices of compatible sizes, and the program will compute their product using Strassen's method.

## Code Breakdown
The code is written in C++ and follows the algorithm steps of Strassen's Matrix Multiplication:

1. **Print Matrix:** A utility function to print a matrix.
2. **Addition:** A function to add two matrices.
3. **Strassen Multiplication:** The main function implementing Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication.
4. **Main Function:** Input matrices A and B, call the multiplication function, and print the result.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication is O(n^log2(7)), which is approximately O(n^2.81). It's an improvement over the traditional O(n^3) complexity of standard matrix multiplication algorithms.

## Application
Strassen's algorithm is useful when dealing with large matrices. It reduces the number of scalar multiplications, making it more efficient than conventional methods for large matrix sizes. Applications include scientific computing, numerical simulations, image processing, and machine learning algorithms where matrix operations are common.

## Future Improvements
- Error Handling: Implement better error handling for input matrices of incompatible sizes.
- Optimization: Further optimize the code for performance improvements.
- Memory Management: Implement efficient memory management techniques to handle large matrices more effectively.

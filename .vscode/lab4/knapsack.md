### Knapsack Problem Algorithm Analysis

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Knapsack Problem algorithm along with a script to generate data for plotting and visualize the algorithm's performance.

### Description

The Knapsack Problem algorithm is implemented to solve the classic optimization problem, where given a set of items each with a weight and a profit value, the goal is to determine the maximum profit that can be obtained by selecting a subset of items without exceeding the capacity of the knapsack. The implementation measures the average time taken by the algorithm to solve the knapsack problem for different scenarios, including sorting items by profit, weight, and profit-to-weight ratio.

### Code Breakdown

- **WriteDataToFile**: Function to write data (number of items, average time taken for different sorting strategies, and solving the knapsack problem) to a file named "knapsack.txt".
- **sort_by_profit**: Function to sort items by profit value.
- **sort_by_weight**: Function to sort items by weight.
- **sort_profitbyweight**: Function to sort items by profit-to-weight ratio.
- **knapsack**: Function to solve the knapsack problem using a greedy approach.
- **Algorithm**: Function to test the performance of the algorithm by solving the knapsack problem for various scenarios and calculating the average time taken for each case.

### Algorithm

1. Generate random weights and profits for a given number of items.
2. Choose a random knapsack weight capacity.
3. Sort items based on profit, weight, and profit-to-weight ratio.
4. Solve the knapsack problem using a greedy approach for each sorting strategy.
5. Calculate the average time taken for solving the knapsack problem for different scenarios.

### Application

The Knapsack Problem has various real-world applications, such as resource allocation, financial portfolio optimization, and project scheduling. It provides an efficient solution for maximizing profit while considering limited resources or constraints.

### Graph Analysis

The graph generated by the provided script illustrates the relationship between the number of items and the average time taken for solving the knapsack problem using different sorting strategies. Analyzing the graph helps understand how different sorting approaches impact the algorithm's performance.

### Usage

To compile and run the program:
```bash
g++ knapsack.cpp -o knapsack
./knapsack
```
Ensure that Gnuplot is installed on your system to visualize the graph.

### Data Generation

The program measures the average time taken by the Knapsack Problem algorithm for solving different scenarios, including sorting items by profit, weight, and profit-to-weight ratio. It conducts experiments for different numbers of items, ranging from 1000 to 100000, and stores the results in the "knapsack.txt" file.

### Repository Structure

- **knapsack.cpp**: Contains the C++ implementation of the Knapsack Problem algorithm and the script to generate data for plotting.

### Binary Search Algorithm Analysis

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Binary Search algorithm along with a script to generate data for plotting and visualize the algorithm's performance.

### Description

The Binary Search algorithm is implemented to search for a target element in a sorted array efficiently. The implementation measures the average time taken by the algorithm to perform binary search on arrays of increasing sizes.

### Code Breakdown

- **WriteDataToFile**: Function to write data (array size and average time taken for binary search) to a file named "data.txt".
- **PlotChart**: Function to plot the graph showing the relationship between array size and average time taken for binary search using Gnuplot.
- **Generate**: Function to generate random integer values for populating the array.
- **binarySearch**: Function implementing the Binary Search algorithm to find the target element in the array.
- **Algorithm**: Function to test the performance of the algorithm by conducting binary searches on arrays of increasing sizes and calculating the average time taken for each size.

### Algorithm

1. Generate a random array of integers.
2. Sort the array in ascending order.
3. Perform binary search on the sorted array to find a random target element.
4. Calculate the average time taken for binary search on arrays of increasing sizes.

### Application

Binary search is a fundamental algorithm used in various applications such as searching, data compression, and cryptography. It efficiently locates an element in a sorted array, making it suitable for tasks requiring fast search operations.

### Graph Analysis

The graph generated by the provided script illustrates the relationship between the size of the input array and the average time taken for binary search. Analyzing the graph helps understand how the algorithm's performance scales with the size of the input data.

### Usage

To compile and run the program:
```bash
g++ binary_search.cpp -o binary_search
./binary_search
```
Ensure that Gnuplot is installed on your system to visualize the graph.

### Data Generation

The program measures the average time taken by the Binary Search algorithm for performing searches on arrays of sizes ranging from 10000 to 100000. It performs 10 iterations for each array size to calculate the average time accurately. The results are stored in the "data.txt" file, with each line containing the array size and the corresponding average time taken for binary search.

### Repository Structure

- **binary_search.cpp**: Contains the C++ implementation of the Binary Search algorithm and the script to generate data for plotting.
- **data.txt**: File where data (array size and average time taken for binary search) is stored.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the repository and its contents.

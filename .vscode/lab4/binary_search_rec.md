### Binary Search (Recursive) Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Binary Search algorithm using recursion along with a script to generate data for plotting.

### Description

The Binary Search algorithm is implemented recursively to search for a key element in a sorted array. Given a sorted array of integers, the algorithm divides the array into halves and compares the key with the middle element. If the key matches the middle element, the search is successful. If the key is smaller, the algorithm searches the left half; otherwise, it searches the right half. This process continues recursively until the key is found or the search range is exhausted.

### Code Breakdown

- **WriteDataToFile**: Function to write data (array size and average time taken for binary search) to a file named "binary_rec_data.txt".
- **PlotChart**: Function to plot the graph of array size versus average time using Gnuplot.
- **Generate**: Function to generate random integers and populate an array of given size.
- **Binary_recursive**: Function implementing the Binary Search algorithm recursively.
- **Algorithm**: Function to test the performance of the Binary Search algorithm by searching for a key in sorted arrays of increasing sizes and calculating the average time taken.
- **main**: The entry point of the program, calling the Algorithm function to execute the Binary Search algorithm and generate data for plotting.

### Algorithm

1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Perform Binary Search recursively:
   - If the search range is not exhausted (low index <= high index):
     - Calculate the middle index of the search range.
     - If the key matches the element at the middle index, return the index.
     - If the key is smaller, recursively search the left half of the array.
     - If the key is larger, recursively search the right half of the array.
   - If the key is not found, return -1.

### Application

Binary Search is widely used in computer science for efficient searching in large sorted datasets. It is utilized in various applications such as search algorithms, databases, and information retrieval systems to quickly locate desired elements.

### Graph Analysis

The graph generated by the provided script illustrates the relationship between the size of the input array and the average time taken for Binary Search. Analyzing the graph helps understand the algorithm's performance and scalability concerning the size of the input array.

### Usage

To compile and run the program:
```bash
g++ binary_search_recursive.cpp -o binary_search_recursive
./binary_search_recursive
```
Ensure that Gnuplot is installed on your system to visualize the graph.

### Data Generation

The program measures the average time taken by the Binary Search algorithm for searching a key in sorted arrays of sizes ranging from 100,000 to 1,000,000. It performs 10 iterations for each array size to calculate the average time accurately. The results are stored in the "binary_rec_data.txt" file, with each line containing the array size and the corresponding average time taken for Binary Search.

### Activity Selector Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Activity Selector algorithm along with a script to generate data for plotting.

### Description

The Activity Selector algorithm is implemented to select the maximum number of activities that can be performed within a given time frame. Given the start and finish times of activities, the algorithm selects a subset of non-overlapping activities that maximize the total number of activities performed. The implementation measures the average time taken by the algorithm for sorting arrays of increasing sizes based on different criteria (start time, finish time, and duration).

### Code Breakdown

- **WriteDataToFile**: Function to write data (array size and average time taken for sorting by start time, finish time, and duration) to a file named "data.txt".
- **sort_by_start**: Function to sort activities by start time.
- **sort_by_end**: Function to sort activities by finish time.
- **sort_by_duration**: Function to sort activities by duration.
- **Activity_Selector**: Function to implement the Activity Selector algorithm and select non-overlapping activities.
- **Algorithm**: Function to test the performance of the algorithm by sorting arrays of increasing sizes based on different criteria and calculating the average time taken for sorting.
- **main**: The entry point of the program, calling the Algorithm function to execute the Activity Selector algorithm and generate data for plotting.

### Algorithm

1. Sort activities based on different criteria (start time, finish time, and duration).
2. Initialize a solution array to store selected activities.
3. Iterate through the sorted activities and select non-overlapping activities.
4. Update the solution array with the selected activities.

### Application

The Activity Selector algorithm is widely used in scheduling and resource allocation problems, such as project management, job scheduling, and classroom scheduling. It helps maximize resource utilization and minimize conflicts by efficiently selecting activities within a given time frame.

### Graph Analysis

The graph generated by the provided script illustrates the relationship between the size of the input array and the average time taken to sort the array based on different criteria (start time, finish time, and duration). Analyzing the graph helps understand how the sorting criteria affect the algorithm's performance and scalability.

### Usage

To compile and run the program:
```bash
g++ activity_selector.cpp -o activity_selector
./activity_selector
```
Ensure that Gnuplot is installed on your system to visualize the graph.

### Data Generation

The program measures the average time taken by the Activity Selector algorithm for sorting arrays of sizes ranging from 1000 to 100000. It performs 10 iterations for each array size to calculate the average time accurately. The results are stored in the "data.txt" file, with each line containing the array size and the corresponding average time taken for sorting by start time, finish time, and duration.

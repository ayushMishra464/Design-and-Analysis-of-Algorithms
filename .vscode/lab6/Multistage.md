### Multistage Graph Implementation

This repository contains a C++ implementation of finding the minimum cost path in a multistage graph using dynamic programming.

### Description

The program implements a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum cost path in a multistage graph. A multistage graph is a directed acyclic graph where the nodes are arranged in multiple stages, and there are edges only between consecutive stages. The goal is to find the minimum cost path from the source node (stage 1) to the destination node (last stage) while minimizing the total cost.

### Code Breakdown

- **multistage_graph**: A function that calculates the minimum cost path in a multistage graph using dynamic programming. It takes the number of stages, the graph adjacency matrix, and the number of vertices as input.
- **main**: The entry point of the program. It initializes the multistage graph with the provided adjacency matrix and calls the `multistage_graph` function to find the minimum cost path.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize an array `fcost[]` to store the minimum cost of reaching each node from the destination node.
2. Start from the destination node and iteratively calculate the minimum cost of reaching each node in the previous stages.
3. Store the minimum cost and the next node in the `fcost[]` and `path[]` arrays.
4. Traverse the `path[]` array to print the minimum cost path from the source to the destination node.

### Usage

To compile and run the program:

```bash
g++ multistage_graph.cpp -o multistage_graph
./multistage_graph
```
